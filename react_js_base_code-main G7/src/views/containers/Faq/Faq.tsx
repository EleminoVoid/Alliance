    question: "How do I book a room?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>To book a room, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Navigate to the Calendar page</li>
          <li>Select your desired date</li>
          <li>Choose a room from the dropdown menu</li>
          <li>Select your start and end times</li>
          <li>Toggle the recurring option if needed</li>
          <li>Click the "Book Room" button to confirm</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between single and recurring bookings?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        A single booking reserves a room for one specific date and time. A
        recurring booking automatically reserves the room for multiple
        instances following a pattern (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly)
        starting from the selected date.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How can I modify or cancel my booking?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        To modify or cancel a booking, go to the "My Bookings" page where you'll
        see all your current reservations. Each booking has a cancel button
        that allows you to remove the reservation. To modify a booking, you'll
        need to cancel it and create a new one with the updated details.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance can I book a room?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Rooms can be booked up to 3 months in advance. This policy helps ensure
        fair access to meeting spaces for all team members.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need to extend my meeting?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        If you need to extend your meeting, check the room's availability for
        the additional time on the Calendar page. If the room is available, you
        can create a new booking for the extended time. If the room is already
        booked, you may need to find an alternative space.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How do I report issues with a room?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        If you encounter any issues with a room (equipment not working,
        cleanliness concerns, etc.), please contact the facilities team at
        facilities@company.com or call extension 1234. Please provide the room
        number, date, time, and a description of the issue.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can I book multiple rooms for the same time?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes, you can book multiple rooms for the same time period. Simply create
        separate bookings for each room you need.
      </p>
    ),
  },
